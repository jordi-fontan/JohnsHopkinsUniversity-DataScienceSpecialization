| Which of the choices involves concrete data that doesn't require any inference or
| generalization?

- 1: Polling before an election to predict its outcome
- 2: Testing the efficacy of a new drug
- 3: Constructing a medical image from fMRI data
- 4: Recording the results of a statistics exam

Selection: 4

| You got it right!

| So statistical inference involves formulating conclusions using data AND quantifying
| the uncertainty associated with those conclusions. The uncertainty could arise from
| incomplete or bad data.

  |================================                                               |  40%
| Which of the following would NOT be a source of bad data?

- 1: Selection bias
- 2: A randomly selected sample of population
- 3: Small sample size
- 4: A poorly designed study

Selection: 2
| That's correct!

  |========================================                                       |  50%
| So with statistical inference we use data to draw general conclusions about a
| population. Which of the following would a scientist using statistical inference
| techniques consider a problem?

- 1: Our data sample is representative of the population
- 2: Contaminated data
- 3: Our study has no bias and is well-designed

Selection: 2

| That's correct!

 |===============================================                                |  60%
| Which of the following is NOT an example of statistical inference in action?

- 1: Determining a causative mechanism underlying a disease
- 2: Counting sheep
- 3: Testing the effectiveness of a medical treatment
- 4: Estimating the proportion of people who will vote for a candidate

Selection: 2

| That's the answer I was looking for.

| We want to emphasize a couple of important points here. First, a statistic (singular)
| is a number computed from a sample of data. We use statistics to infer information
| about a population. Second, a random variable is an outcome from an experiment.
| Deterministic processes, such as computing means or variances, applied to random
| variables, produce additional random variables which have their own distributions.
| It's important to keep straight which distributions you're talking about.


  |===============================================================                |  80%
| Finally, there are two broad flavors of inference. The first is frequency, which uses
| "long run proportion of times an event occurs in independent, identically distributed
| repetitions." The second is Bayesian in which the probability estimate for a
| hypothesis is updated as additional evidence is acquired. Both flavors require an
| understanding of probability so that's what the next lessons will cover.
